Hello I am practicing open software. 

This blog is an end-of-term assignment, and you will complete your own blog.

I wanted to change the main color of the blog, but I couldn't find a way to do it, so I left it in blue.

If there is a fix, I would appreciate it if you could give me some advice via pull requests at **https://github.com/mz-17/mz**.
